# Desk-weather-station-with-a-game-on-the-led-bar
The station was created in 2020 to summarize the acquired knowledge, the whole program was able to do several things "at once", it had a simple menu located on the led strip in which you can manually adjust the color of the cursor on the strip by mixing the basic colors in different proportions and changing the brightness itself , which was later seen during other activities, for example a game in which you had to catch a escaping pixel that accelerated each time it was caught, in addition, the weather station constantly displayed data on the LCD screen related to the current interaction, such as the sum of the cursor colors set.
